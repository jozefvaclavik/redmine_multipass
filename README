For redmine 1.4 and older, see the right branch/tag, this one is suitable for 2.2

MultiPass SSO Authentication plugin for Redmine (v 0.0.1)

=======

This plugin is based on MultiPass gem (https://github.com/entp/multipass) and allows
users to register and login to the application with Single Sign On (SSO) link.
Configuration on both sides (Redmine and Custom app) is needed. Please read Configuration
instruction.

Requirements
=======

This plugin requires MultiPass gem installed.

gem install multipass

For redmine 1.3 and newer:
Edit your Gemfile and add there
gem 'multipass'

Installation
=======

1. cd plugins; git clone git://github.com/jozefvaclavik/redmine_multipass.git
2. cd ..; rake redmine:plugins:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
3. restart redmine

Edit config/routes.rb and add these four lines AFTER first line.

match 'multipass', :controller => 'multipass', :action => 'index'
match 'multipass/index', :controller => 'multipass', :action => 'index'
match 'multipass/successful_authentication', :controller => 'multipass', :action => 'successful_authentication'
match 'multipass/register', :controller => 'multipass', :action => 'register'

Configuration
=======

Redmine:

- Enable => Enable/Disable plugin.
- Debug Mode => Enable/Disable debug mode. While enabled, instead of proceeding
  User information to login/register, decrypted information are displayed.
- Self Registration => Enalbe/Disable registration mode.
- Support Email => Contact information in case that SSO Auth will fail to login/register
- Group => User group, where newly created users will be added
- SSO Api Key => SSO Key for encryption/decryption
- Site Key => Site key used for encryption/decryption


Custom app: EXAMPLE USSAGE
- In User.rb model:
site_key and sso_api_key are string values from redmine settings

def self.multipass
  @multipass ||= MultiPass.new(site_key, sso_api_key)
end

# create a multipass for this user object
def multipass
	users_remote_uid = "#{site_key}_#{id}"
	user_mail = "Obtain users email"
	user_first_name = "Obtain users first name"
	user_last_name = "Obtain users last name"
	user_login = "Obtain users login"
	self.class.multipass.encode(:email => user_mail, :first_name => user_first_name, :last_name => user_last_name, :login => user_login, :remote_uid => users_remote_uid, :expires => 30.minutes.from_now)
end

- In your view:
Assume that @user is currently logged in user

<%= link_to( "Open Redmine", "http://link_to_your_redmine_app/multipass/?sso=#{CGI.escape(@user.multipass)}") %>

PHP Support:
If your custom application is based on PHP, take a look at Tomdchi PHP version of multipass library. https://github.com/tomdchi/Redmine-PHP-MultiPass
